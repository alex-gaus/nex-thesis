This is the repository for the code I used in my bachelor thesis about named entity recognition.

This [article](https://medium.com/dpa-newslab/8-lessons-learned-about-ner-f40b263490db) summarizes what my thesis is about.

The repository contains several python functions, with which I did the following:

* Downloading newswire text from the German Press agency and writing them into a database
* Selecting texts and saving them localy so they can be uploaded to the annotation tool webanno
* Making api-requests with these texts for 6 different NER-tools
* Standardizing the results from the tool and writing the results in the database

I am quite a beginner in python, my code is not well documented and structured. For further questions please contact me.
